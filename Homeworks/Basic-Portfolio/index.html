                    <p>My name is Varun Master and I want to be a Full-Stack developer and eventually work in the DevOps side of a firm. I am a very self-motivated individual and ready to dive head first and learn as much as possible. I am also very much interested in networking and have set up my own personal home network. Outside of the IT world, I am a powerlifter.</p>
